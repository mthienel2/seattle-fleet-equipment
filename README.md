# Seattle Fleet Equipment
Using the [Sold Fleet Equipment](https://data.seattle.gov/City-Business/Sold-Fleet-Equipment/y6ef-jf2w) dataset provided by the City of Seattle, I created a number of visuals and a dashboard to visualize equipment sold, month-to-month revenue, and fleet equipment age when sold. For the visualization I used Tableau Desktop, and for analysis I used Microsoft Excel.
